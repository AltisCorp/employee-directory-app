# Employee Directory App #

Employee Directory allows you to look for employees by name, view their details, add them to your contacts, and see their manager and direct reports, as well as call, text, or email them.

Employee Directory always accesses the employee data from a local database on your iPhone. The information is always available, even when you are offline.

The application comes with a sample dataset to provide an "out-of-the-box" experience, and with a simple offline synchronization mechanism to sync with your own data.
